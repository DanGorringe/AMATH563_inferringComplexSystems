# AMATH 563 Inferring Complex Systems
---
## Personal Preamble
AMATH563 is examined by equally weighted courseworks, this is my repository. This kinda course is my jam, but might be out of my league.

## Course Info
Introduces fundamental concepts of network science and graph theory for complex dynamical systems. Merges concepts from model selection, information theory, statistical inference, neural networks, deep learning, and machine learning for building reduced order models of dynamical systems using sparse sampling of high-dimensional data.
